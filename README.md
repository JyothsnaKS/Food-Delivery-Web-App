# Food-Delivery-Web-App

Foodicted is a web application developed by us to provide online food ordering and delivery and restaurant table reservation services to our customers. Our customers can order food or reserve table at a restaurant online based on the type of the cuisine they like, the location, the price range etc. We communicate with our users through SMS and e-mails.  Our customers are required to create an account on our website to ensure security and a customised experience when further enhancements are done on the website.

## Key Features:
•	Dynamic page for table reservation  with use of filters to allow customers to search for restaurants of their choice and reserve table depending on the number of people and selected time slot and prompts if the restaurant is running full (with a help of a separate table maintaining the current status of seats available).
•	Email service to confirm table reservation
•	Dynamic feedback page to get customer feedback and display the same while allowing  them to like or comment on others feedback.
•	Dynamic page to display the order placed by the user (food order cart), bill summary and  choice of location to deliver the placed order.
•	SMS service to confirm the order for delivery
•	Google Maps to display current location and give the user a choice to deliver the food to his/her current location
•	Designing the complete home page with login & sign up options, navigation menu to direct to other pages and header and footer to be rendered  on each page of our website. 
•	Option for customers to tweet about our organisation  on Twitter
•	Option to view Facebook and LinkedIn pages of the founders
